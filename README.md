# Transiter

Transiter is a web service for distributing realtime transit information.
Transiter consumes data from transit agencies (typically in
    GTFS realtime format), and provides intuitive
    access to it through a simple REST API.

Transiter is currently in the initial development phase.
Version 0.1 will be somewhere between a refactor and a total rewrite of the
current backend of the realtimerail.nyc web app.

See the documentation on Read The Docs.
