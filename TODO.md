TODO: add github issue to add logging configuration


printing config is broken?



The task server:
Can we run multi process and get around warnings about 123456?
Also suppress the warnings! <- This. we should support refreshing the 
feed at a smaller periodicity than the feed update takes
Workaround is to increase the refresh time

    ./taskserver/server.py
    ./taskserver/client.py
    


1. Record the git hash outside of the Git repo for deployments ... 
    maybe when building the egg?
Incorporate this into building and distributing the App


Distribute the App somehow on PyPI
