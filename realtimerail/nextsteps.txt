Main dev thread:
 - next add a feeds.csv file and import that
 - build out the basic route, station and stop services, feed GET method
 - soft feed introduction: write the XML update code
 - then incorporate the GTFS code!
 - add the terminus abbr table and load the data. Can this be done in a way
    that is not so specific to the NYC subway?



Other tasks
- Make route list entries better (rename). Add relationship to Stop
    like daytime_routes, evening_routes etc.
- write the feed health code, including having a database table that tracks
    feed updates....or a protobuf file is probably better
    Maybe need a feed runnable that deletes old feed data
- write the optimized topological sort algorithm for generating routes lists
    (better name than route lists?)
- write the version of topological sort
    that also takes additional paths to help order disconnected
    components
