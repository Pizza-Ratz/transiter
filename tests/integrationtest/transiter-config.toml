# The driver and dialect settings are used to specify which DBMS is in use
# and which Python package to use to connect to it. Currently officially 
# supported options:
#
# | DBMS       | Driver     | Dialect    | Additional python packages required |
# |------------+------------+------------+-------------------------------------|
# | SQLite     | sqlite     |            |                                     |
# | Postgresql | postgresql | psycopg2   | psycopg2-binary                     |

# Host settings. If using Postgres or another client/server DBMS the database
# can be on a separate machine to the Transiter instance. If running the

# recommended to use Unix domain sockets instead of TCP, in which case the
# host and port settings should be empty

# The port that the task server listens on. This is used both when
